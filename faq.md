### How do I access the BMI cluster?

If you are a new employee or have never needed to use the cluster before, your access is tied to your CCHMC username and password. However, you must go through an approval process or you will get a permission denied error when trying to connect. 

First, contact the cluster team at help-cluster@bmi.cchmc.org. They will grant you general access to the cluster, and you can start working right away within your personal directory under "/users/".

Second, request access to the specific division/lab directories you need. Contact the CuSTOM/DB bioinformatics team if you plan to use CuSTOM-Genomics, CuSTOM-DB-Bioinformatics, or CuSTOM-DB-NGS. Other directories you may need to contact your supervisor. Note that the cluster team cannot grant access to specific directories. 

Finally, use your method of choice to login to the cluster. Either ssh from the command line, use FTP software like WinSCP or FileZilla, or map it as a drive depending on your needs.
